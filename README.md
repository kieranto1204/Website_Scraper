For this challenge I don't believe there is any special set up, as long as you properly clone this repo you should be able to run the code in your coding language of choice.

This challenge was split in 2 parts and focused on having us scrape information from a site, based around Mars news and temperature/atmospheric pressure.

Part 1:
- Identify the elements on the "Mars news site"
- Extract the text elements using Beautiful Soup
    - Store Python dictionaries for both title and preview.

Part 2:
- Inspect and scrape the elements present on the "Mars Temperature Data Site" (URL: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html)
- Use a Beautiful soup object to scrape the data into an html table.
- Create a Pandas DataFrame, and for columns use the columns on the website (id, terrestrial_data, sol, ls, month, min_temp, pressure)
- Convert data types for the columns to the appropriate data types.
- Analyze and graph the minimum temperature per month on mars and the atmospheric pressure per month on mars.
- Estimate how many earth days are there per martian year.
- Write a quick analysis on the warmest/coldest and highest/lowest atmospheric pressure month on mars.
- Write a quick analysis on how many earth days are in a martian year.
- Create a csv file.
